# C Compiler from Scratch

## About the Project
This project is a fully functional **C Compiler** built entirely from scratch in the C programming language. It supports a majority of the core functionalities of C, making it a versatile and comprehensive tool for compiling C programs.

The compiler is designed to handle all the essential constructs and features of the C language, offering a robust foundation for understanding compiler design and development.

---

## Features
The compiler supports the following major functionalities:

1. **Structures**  
2. **Unions**  
3. **C Statements**:  
   - `if`, `else`, `else if`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `goto`, `switch`, `break`, `continue`  
4. **Bitwise Operators**  
5. **Logical Operators**:  
   - `||` (OR), `&&` (AND)  
6. **Numerical Operators**:  
   - Arithmetic operations like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
7. **Functions**  
8. **Pointers**  
9. **Arrays**  
10. **Function Calls**  
11. **Macro System and Preprocessor Directives**:  
    - `#define`, `#include`, and others  


## Installation Requirements
GCC or any standard C compiler
Makefile (if applicable)
A Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)

## References
This project was developed using the following references for guidance and understanding of compiler design concepts:

## PeachCompiler by nibblebits
## Compiler Design in C by Allen I. Holub (also known as the Galvan book)
These resources were invaluable in building this compiler and gaining deeper insights into compiler theory and implementation.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the compiler! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. bCreate a new branch for your feature/bugfix.
3. Commit your changes with clear descriptions.
4. Open a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by a deep interest in compiler design and aims to be an educational resource for students and enthusiasts exploring the fundamentals of C and compiler development.
